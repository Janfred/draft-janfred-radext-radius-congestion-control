 Methods for Mitigation of Congestion and Load Issues on RADIUS Servers
         draft-janfred-radext-radius-congestion-control-latest

Abstract

   The RADIUS protocol as defined in [RFC2865] does not have a means to
   signal server overload or congesition to the clients.  This can lead
   to load problems, especially in a federated RADIUS proxy fabric.
   This document attempts to fix this.

1.  Introduction

   The RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] does not have a means to signal a
   server overload or a congestion to RADIUS clients.  These overload
   situations may be a result of a high load of legitimate traffic and
   might even be worsened by retransmissions of packets the server
   failed to answer due to the high load.  These situation can happen in
   a lost of scenarios.  In RADIUS proxy fabric, a server overload may
   even result from a single RADIUS client, for example when an EAP
   supplicant immediately starts a new authentication try without delay
   when getting a reject.

   Especially in RADIUS proxy fabrics, the impact of misbehaving clients
   on the whole proxy chain can be reduced by reducing the packet load
   at the entry level or as early in the proxy chain as possible.  Since
   the end user device cannot be controlled, we have to rely on the
   RADIUS proxies to implement coutermeasures.

   These countermeasures can be used to reduce the load by one of two
   methods.

   First, the response to requests can be delayed.  By delaying RADIUS
   responses, the client has to wait for the answer to send its next
   request, which decreases the packet load on the server.  This method
   can also be used to slow down clients that immediately retry the
   authentication once they receive a reject.

   When a home server knows that an authentication of this client cannot
   succeed (for example because it used an expired certificate with EAP-
   TLS), and the client keeps retrying, any RADIUS actor along the proxy
   chain could generate a reject for this specific user.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

4.  Security Considerations

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document will have IANA actions.  They are still TODO in detail.

   Roughly the following things should be allocated

   *  Attribute Type (possibly from extended attributes) for Delay-
      Capability of type string

   *  Attribute Type (possibly from extended attributes) for Response-
      Delay of type tlv

   *  New registry table for types in the Response-Delay attributes

      -  0 - reserved

      -  1 - Response-Delay, Type integer, delay request in milliseconds

      -  2 - Response-Block, Type integer, request to stop sending data
         for this particular user for period of time, time in seconds

      -  3 - Response-Block-Attributes
